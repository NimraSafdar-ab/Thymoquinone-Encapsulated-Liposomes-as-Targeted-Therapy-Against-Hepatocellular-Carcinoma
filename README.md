# Thymoquinone-Encapsulated-Liposomes-as-Targeted-Therapy-Against-Hepatocellular-Carcinoma
*Product Name: LivCure*
(A natural-origin, nano-formulated therapy designed to target liver cancer)
Core Objective:
Develop a liposome-based drug delivery system encapsulating thymoquinone (TQ) from Nigella sativa to treat hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with increased precision and reduced side effects.
In Silico Work:
Designed lipid bilayer using CHARMM-GUI (DPPC base)
Embedded DSPE-PEG-NH₂ into the bilayer
Attached ligands (Galactose / Transferrin / Quinazoline) to target HCC-specific receptors
Conducted ligand-receptor binding affinity analysis for targeting efficiency
In Vitro (Wet Lab) Work:
Extracted thymoquinone (TQ) from Nigella sativa seeds using methanol and rotary evaporation
Formulated liposomes using the thin film hydration method
Encapsulated TQ into liposomes for stable delivery
Phase separation and encapsulation efficiency analysis in progress
Targeted Receptors:
ASGPR, Transferrin receptor, EGFR – commonly overexpressed in liver cancer
Therapeutic Goal:
Deliver TQ directly to liver tumor cells via ligand-guided targeting, minimizing damage to healthy tissues
Future Scope:
In vitro cytotoxicity and cellular uptake analysis
Animal model testing
Commercial development of LivCure as an injectable therapy
